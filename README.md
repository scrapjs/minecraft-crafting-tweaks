## Minecraft mod or datapack for 2x2 crafts

### Overview

- Overhaul crafting recipes for 2x2 grid.
- Promised compatibility with Vanilla Tweaks.
- Working on correct balance.
- Modular datapack (split into few).
- More cut copper recipes (mostly, 2x2).
- Doors and trapdoors can be created from wooden logs.

### Spitted to modules

- Core datapack for 1.19 (with packing 2x2).
- Disable default slabs and enable plates.
- Disable default stairs.
- Enable slabs 2x1 crafts.
- Enable stairs 2x2 crafts.
- Extra copper 2x2 crafts.
- Extra wooden log 2x2 crafts.
- Craft recipes 2x2 for items and tools (new!).
- Overhaul download link.

### TODO

- Add missed blocks
- Add additional features
- Add advancements (finally)

### Problems

This datapack is balanced for 4x raw ores, NOT for 9x. <br/>
To fix coal fuel balance, needs mod.
